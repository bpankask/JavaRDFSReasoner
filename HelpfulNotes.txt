Notes on Rules and Rules.txt file:
 	* GrdfD1 is implemented but has only been lightly tested.  Technically, to turn this rule on the container membership axioms would also have to be altered to add the axioms for rdf:_1 if no others
 		were added.

Order in which rules are activated:
	* The Apache Jena documentation says that there is no way to guarantee the order in which rules fire.  While this is true for rules in the same rule file you can split the rules up into different 
		rule files and reason over the inference model created by the previous reasoning.
