This is an aggregate relation, which should \n       be a tertiary relation of the form {?Event convinced ?Agent toDo ?Action}.\n       Because of the binary relation limitation of OWL, this is compressed into\n       a binary relation in which the second argument is an Action that specifies\n       a specific Action performed by some specific Agent.  To determine the Agent that\n       was convinced by the Event of argument1, it will be necessary to extract the\n       Agent from the Action instance.  This relation expresses the notion of \n       something a PersistentState, a physical Event or some social Event such as a discussion \n       convincing someone to think something, believe something, to feel some\n       emotion, or to do some action.\n       NOTE that causing someone to believe something is a subproperty represented by\n         causedToBelieve.\n         \n        NOTE: the things that can be caused are varied, and the things that can\n        cause people to think or do things are also quite varied.  This relationship\n        is expressed linguistically in a number of different ways:\n           P did Y because of Z\n           Z caused P to do Y\n           Z induced P to do Y\n           Z made P do Y\n           Z got P to do Y\n         \n           see also related elements:\n               hasPurpose\n               hasIntendedResultOrProduct\n               hasPurposeOfObtaining\n               isSatisfactoryForPurpose\n               isaMethodTo\n               desires\n               Benefit -st- Sake\n\n     NOTE:         The formation of a Goal or Intention can also be motivated by Events, \n         indeed convincing an agent to Action implies causing formation of\n         a Goal and Intention. perhaps this relation should also imply a relation\n         such as createdGoalInAgent - not represented yet.  But \n         Goals are mental Objects that reference possible future states\n         which would be the states intended to arise as the result of the Action\n         pointed to by convincedAgentToAction. \n         @ToDo: should link Goal somehow - how?  Here also here are multiple elements\n         that are best represented by a multiple-arity relation.  \n      \n      NOTE that although this relation name indicates Action, the Action can\n      be a strictly mental event even a stative Event such as believing something\n      or having some emotional reaction such as fear or eager anticipation.\n      This relation or more specifically its subproperty  \n      \n      causedToBelieve \n      can be used to express the results of some action taken by one\n      person or organization to persuade someone else to believe something.  The causative \n      Event, however, need not be a deliberate attempt at persuasion; some natural event can persuade \n      people to believe something or to take action, and this relation can be broadly\n      utilized to express, for example, that some astronomical event convinced a scientist that\n      some physical law is true; or that some natural disaster convinced people to move their\n      residence.\n            \n      NOTE that this is an instance-level relation, and cannot be used\n       to state that some type of Event typically or always causes some\n       type of mental effect.  For the type-level relation use causesMentalEvent.\n       \n       The agent may be extracted by a chained relation:\n       \n       Corresponds to part of verb sense 2 of cause, sense 4 of makesense 10\n         of get and sense 2 of induce in WordNet; the phrase \n       moved him to . . . can also be a linguistic expression of this notion; see also the subproperty\n         convincedAgentToAction:\n            2. 46 induce, stimulate, cause, have, get, make - - cause to do;\n                cause to act in a specified manner; The ads induced me to buy a VCR; \n                My children finally got me to buy a computer; My wife made me buy a new sofa\n       ",":Now rdfs:comment Now is a TimePoint that is referenced as the time at which\n      some sentence is created, and at which the assertions of the\n      sentence are true; if the sentence is in the past or future tenses, the\n      past or future are referenced to the time of the sentence.\n      Each assertion that is indexed in Time\n      has an implicit Now.

People are the Agents that are typically \n       of greatest interest.  But Tornadoes,  hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanoes, etc. \n       can behave a agents in that they cause external events due to their internal \n       processes.  All of these agentic objects are included in this category, but \n       Organizations, which are classified as MentalObjects in this ontology, are \n       in a separate agentive category.","045f8df4-2295-4666-b1a0-04c1f75040a6 owl:hasValue rdfs:Class",":Equipment rdf:type now","8549a4fb-600d-469e-97a6-b8d75e37fe38 rdfs:subClassOf :Attractive",":Western rdf:type bd58c33c-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270",":Deforming rdfs:domain :PreparedFoodStuff",":Carpet rdfs:subClassOf :StoppingEvent",":Resin rdf:first :AgentiveObject",":AshWednesday rdf:type :GroupOfBeasts",":Fulcrum rdf:type :Conveyance",":QualitativeAttributeType rdfs:comment rdfs:Resource",":hasSpatialPart :wnsense :GroupOfBeasts",":FixedStructure rdf:type :LightOliveBrown-Color",":HumanScaleObject rdfs:subClassOf :Region","8549a4fb-600d-469e-97a6-b8d75e37fe38 rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class",":GroupOfBeasts :wordnet bf97c9ac-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270",":Change rdf:type stop",":RuleForBehavior rdf:type rdf:nil",":Resin rdfs:comment bf97c9ac-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270",":Line rdf:type The SUMO term for LightingDevice.",":PastTimeInterval :ldoce rdfs:Class","9e872718-23fb-4f10-a2bf-024e15fc548d rdf:type owl:Class","6a49c366-6d98-4436-825b-e54cf1c5555b rdfs:subClassOf :_SuccessorFn_Integer_","57cb575b-7514-498b-aa4d-a5a5185c62c6 :wnsense :Cattle",":isMentionedIn rdf:type :Rural","rdf:rest :ldoce :RoleType","13d77926-0775-41aa-baa4-19e826d9b72e :wnsense efa19a6b-e23a-4092-914d-23cd5a8c3241",":AceticAcid :ldoce rdfs:Resource",":Smith :wnsense currently","d1212a36-52bc-4391-99b4-578ecf81fea4 rdf:type :QualitativeAttributeType",":ToastingSomething rdfs:comment :LocationAttribute","7450852d-e107-4d16-a7b9-f0c0c900e328 rdfs:subClassOf rdf:List",":Bathroom rdf:type :Insect",":House rdf:type :Role","rdf:Seq rdf:type rdf:Property",":Adverb rdf:type :GroupOfPeople"]}
