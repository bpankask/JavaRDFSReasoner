Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa such as the epicondyles of the humerus and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation dislocation of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint the related anatomical structure.","8fb52c7f-3845-406d-8be3-334bf7696560 rdf:rest rdf:nil","schema:expectedPrognosis rdfs:range xsd:string","schema:exercisePlan rdfs:label exercise plan","schema:version rdfs:label version","b1eb07c7-af92-4677-9502-bb43f36ca1f9 owl:unionOf 6f04319a-780d-42f7-b8b2-85574a78da35","schema:normalRange rdfs:domain schema:MedicalTest","schema:Mosque rdfs:comment A mosque.","9a9e93de-d2e9-4f4b-a1ff-d69c3ce25a91 rdf:rest rdf:nil","schema:ItemListOrderDescending rdfs:comment An ItemList ordered with higher values listed first.","3d2adaa0-415b-4188-acfb-a2b82252519f rdf:first schema:Organization","75d936fe-fb04-4a99-a5b5-cd0c644ca76d rdf:rest rdf:nil","schema:acquiredFrom rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:TipAction rdfs:comment The act of giving money voluntarily to a beneficiary in recognition of services rendered.","87f19980-36fa-41de-9202-c0705311e096 owl:unionOf c2695f12-b503-4f83-999b-5a72453b853c","schema:ApprovedIndication rdfs:comment An indication for a medical therapy that has been formally specified or approved by a regulatory body that regulates use of the therapy; for example, the US FDA approves indications for most drugs in the US.","schema:MarryAction rdf:type owl:Class","schema:SuperficialAnatomy rdf:type owl:Class","61e0051d-1d16-4914-83d8-ece92ec3ad54 owl:unionOf d3f0b3e5-eadf-44f6-baec-f1a224de1c11","schema:Paperback rdfs:comment Book format: Paperback.","schema:breastfeedingWarning rdfs:range xsd:string","schema:opens rdfs:domain schema:OpeningHoursSpecification","schema:videoFormat rdfs:comment The type of screening or video broadcast used e.g. IMAX, 3D, SD, HD, etc..","schema:Park rdfs:label Park","61e0051d-1d16-4914-83d8-ece92ec3ad54 rdf:type owl:Class","5ddb3ec9-bf6c-47e5-9753-28cd9e0ade71 rdf:first schema:Episode","schema:Country rdfs:label Country","schema:knows rdfs:label knows","schema:acceptedOffer rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:homeTeam rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:possibleTreatment rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:MedicalContraindication rdfs:subClassOf schema:MedicalEntity","schema:version rdfs:comment The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource.","schema:GeneralContractor rdfs:subClassOf schema:HomeAndConstructionBusiness","schema:NewCondition rdfs:comment Indicates that the item is new.","schema:warrantyPromise rdfs:label warranty promise","schema:expectedPrognosis rdfs:domain schema:MedicalCondition","schema:warrantyPromise rdfs:domain e39abe3e-5cc5-4ffc-aa55-c3bdea2c0ff1","schema:PrimaryCare rdfs:label Primary care","schema:DataFeed rdfs:label Data feed","schema:isAccessibleForFree rdfs:comment A flag to signal that the publication is accessible for free.","schema:isProprietary rdfs:range xsd:boolean","schema:QAPage rdfs:label QAPage","schema:acceptedOffer rdfs:label accepted offer","schema:significantLink rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty","schema:signOrSymptom rdfs:label sign or symptom","schema:SearchAction rdfs:subClassOf schema:Action","schema:events schema:supersededBy schema:event","schema:Neuro rdf:type schema:PhysicalExam","schema:Distance rdfs:subClassOf schema:Quantity","schema:PhotographAction rdfs:subClassOf schema:CreateAction","schema:Ligament rdfs:subClassOf schema:AnatomicalStructure","schema:Country rdfs:comment A country.","schema:BowlingAlley rdfs:subClassOf schema:SportsActivityLocation","schema:Pond rdfs:comment A pond.","fa84847e-6313-4ca0-ab32-a5b33dfb8a8d rdf:rest 85596628-44b9-4f38-916a-fd15cbfc8e88","schema:physiologicalBenefits rdfs:range xsd:string","schema:scheduledTime rdfs:range xsd:dateTime","eb4f37f7-086b-43dc-8bda-2754caa93025 rdf:rest 5d31ce47-3b4d-4bb7-99e5-b48e8ab4d8ee","schema:Notary rdfs:label Notary","schema:CommentAction rdf:type owl:Class","schema:sibling rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:discussionUrl rdfs:range xsd:anyURI","schema:acquiredFrom rdfs:domain schema:OwnershipInfo","schema:knows rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty","schema:Park rdfs:comment A park.","schema:Dentistry rdfs:comment Dentistry.","schema:openingHoursSpecification rdfs:label opening hours specification","schema:box rdfs:comment A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points.
