The distinction between Goal as a MentalObject\n\t  and GoalSituation allows the ontology to reify a\n\t  persons goals without any knowledge of the actual situation\n\t  that would satisfy the goals.  One can therefore talk about a goal,\n\t  and separately about a situation that satisfies the goal - in this\n\t  usage, the goal appears to be a MentalObject distinct from the \n\t  GoalSituation.  A Goal is in the Mind of a single individual;\n\t  though more than one person may have the same GoalSituation more\n\t  than one person may want to work toward the same state of affars,\n\t  e.g. World Peace, the Goals of those individuals are personal\n\t  to each of them.\n       \n       A Goal is a MentalObject that relates to a Situation that\n         an IntelligentAgent desires and intends to make happen by taking some\n         action. In COSMO a Goal is a Group of MentalObjects that necessarily \n         includes a Desire - because the Goal references something that an Agent wants\n         to happen, which is the characteristic of a Desire.  A Goal,\n         in addition to the desire to see something happen, includes the \n         intention expectation that the Agent her/himself will take some\n         action to help make that thing happen.\n                  \n         NOTE that a Goal includes an Intention, but differs from an\n         Intention in that the Goal references a situation that the\n         Agent desires but *is not currently existing**, whereas an Intention \n         to do something does not necessarily imply that the action will\n         change the situation he intends to keep quiet for the next ten minute\n         and intending to do something does not imply that the Agent wants the\n         FutureSituation to happen for the Agents own purposes -\n         agent could intend to do something demanded by someone\n         else..  The difference between an Intention and a Goal is that\n         an Intention references a future Actikon, while a Goal references\n         a future desired State.\n         \n        COSMO note: In OpenCyc a Goal is a subtype of\n        #ELSentence-Assertible - i.e. an assertion.  Although the Cyc \n        representation of Goal includes many of the intuitions that seem to be contained in \n        the usual meaning of Goal, the linguistic usage appears to be closer\n        to the notion of the goal being the realization of the actual situation\n        that an agent usually a person wants to become true; however, the Goal is \n        in the mind of the IntelligentAgent, and is created by the IntelligentAgent,\n        but is not a PhysicalObject, threfore is best represented as  MentalObject\n        in COSMO, rather than the situation itself.  It necessarily includes \n        some intention, but is not the intention itself.  So the representation\n        of a Goal must include each of these elements in relation to each other.\n        \n        NOTE that a Goal is a MentalObject that *references* some desired FutureSituation, but\n        is not itself the desired FutureSituation; a Goal is internal to\n        an agent, not just a state of affairs in the exgternal world..  When the \n        FutureSituation has occurred and is no longer in the Future,\n        the Goal itself must terminate its\n        existence, and the Goal will be located in the past, \n        \n        Restrictions specify that every instance of Goal must specify the\n        IntentionalAgent who has the goal through the relation wasCreatedBy\n        and the DesiredFutureSituation that has caused that Goal to arise.\n\n        Cyc:  Typically, this attribute characterizes\n            relationships holding between Cyc formulas and a particular\n            agent when the formula describes a state of affairs that the\n            agent intends to take steps to actualize, i.e., when\n            actualizing the state of affairs is a goal of the agent.\n            However, it might also be seen as an attribute of the\n            relationship between the agent and the static situation\n            depicted by that cyc formula see #$StateFn.  This is the\n            most general goal attribute and should be used only when one\n            is unable to specify more exactly what kind of goal the\n            relevant state of affairs is for an agent.\n            \n         ToDo: axioms must specify that the FutureSituation\n          of the Desire and Intention are the same, and that the\n          Agent that has the Goal will be a participant in the\n          FutureSituaion.\n         \n         Corresponds to FIBO goal:\n           SKOS def: 1 A goal is a desired result a person or a system envisions,\n            plans and commits to achieve a personal or organizational desired end-point \n            in some sort of assumed development.
