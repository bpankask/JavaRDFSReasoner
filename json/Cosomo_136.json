Each\n            #$Probability is a degree or range of likelihoods that\n            can be attributed to a statement with respect to the\n            likelihood of its being or becoming true.  Although not\n            #$MeasurableQuantityies q.v. in the full sense of that\n            term, probabilities are often characterized and compared\n            numerically, along a scale from 0 to 1.  #$ProbabilityFn 0\n            is icertain falsity/i and #$ProbabilityFn\n            1 is icertain truth/i.  See also\n            #$ProbabilityInterval, the collection of all real number\n            intervals between 0 and 1 inclusive, and thus of all\n            possible arguments for #$ProbabilityFn.\n\n         The plural form chances is also used in essentially the same\n            sense. e.g.: What are the chances that a meteor will fall in the yard? -\n            same as What is the probability that a meteor will fall in the yard?\n            The difference may be only one of formality.  The form chances \n            may suggest an answer in the form of a ratio - odds, such as\n            1 in a million.\n                        \n         Corresponds to noun sense 1 of probability and noun sense 4\n             of chance and sense 1 of likelihood and sense 1 of odds  in WordNet:\n           WN chance:\n             4. 2 probability, chance - a measure of how likely it is that\n                some event will occur; a number expressing the ratio of favorable \n                cases to the whole number of cases possible; the probability that \n                an unbiased coin will fall with the head up is 0.5\n           WN noun likelihood:\n             1. 2 likelihood, likeliness - the probability of a specified outcome\n           WN noun odds:\n             1. 1 odds - the likelihood of a thing occurring rather than not occurring\n          ",":GrowingEvent :wnsense growth1n",":OutdoorLocation :guid bd58b186-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270","d6987509-6293-45c7-bfe6-64eff5ec3f3d rdf:type owl:Class",":Pregnancy rdf:type owl:Class",":Explaining rdf:type :ActionType",":Homeotherm :guid bd59432f-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270",":Meninges rdfs:subClassOf :AnimalBodyPart",":PatsCarBattery :isOwnedBy :PatrickCassidy",":Rushing :wnsense hurry1v",":PumpingGasEvent rdf:type owl:Class",":OutdoorLocation :wnsense out1adv",":ReflectiveObject rdf:type owl:Class","4a53428c-5412-4786-b53e-5eab4881777c rdf:type owl:Class",":isLargerThan rdfs:domain 8416aec5-cbc8-4c36-b695-556964c6db71",":Rushing :en hurrying",":Crow rdfs:subClassOf :CorvineBird",":Frequency rdfs:subClassOf b05021d1-c644-4f29-9449-446be1c7898f",":Probability :wordnet probability",":Hydrogen :hasProtonCount 1^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int",":HairAccessory rdfs:comment Decorative and/or functional gee-gaws worn in the\n            hair.

The Federal Aviation Administration is making\n\tsimilar changes for airplanes. Automakers are increasingly using plus-size \n\tdummies to test their seat belts and air bags.\n           According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n        a solid majority of Americans, 65 percent, are overweight. The average American \n        man grew from 166 pounds in 1960 to 191 pounds in 2002, while the average womans\n        weight rose from 140 to 164 pounds.\n            These overweight and obese people can affect other people, said Shin-Yi Chou,\n\ta professor at Lehigh University who studies the economics of obesity.\n\tWhen you increase the weight aboard airplanes, for example, there is an increased risk.\n\tWe probably need government intervention.\n            Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that an outdated \n         passenger weight formula was partly to blame when a water shuttle in Baltimore Harbor\n         capsized in March 2004, killing five people.\n             The Lady D set out with 25 people aboard, the maximum allowed by Coast Guard\n         rules based on a 40-year-old estimate that the average person weighs 140 pounds.\n         In fact, the people aboard averaged 168 pounds. The boat overturned when winds \n         gusted suddenly.\n        ","c984769c-47ea-497d-a1cb-262f2287b2a0 rdf:type :InformationBearingWavePropagation",":BiologicalLivingObject rdf:type d1f13b75-56b1-4ad6-9b74-4cce073d0798",":BeingTiredOfSomething rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class","rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subClassOf owl:ObjectProperty",":SwitchingaDeviceOff rdf:type :hasCrossSectionalShape","de32d38c-88b3-4f51-accb-52a869e026b4 rdf:type :Covering-Object",":PhysicalEvidence rdfs:comment foot1n","60980ad3-6157-46fb-819d-3a4448d98881 rdf:type rdfs:Class",":Seam rdf:type 86c5f1db-8fd6-40c5-8a15-87b6bfaca265",":AbstractSymbolicObject :wordnet rdfs:Resource",":InformationBearingWavePropagation rdfs:subClassOf :ObjectWithAttribute","8bc21800-32f3-4e85-9b2e-eb254d69d2c2 rdf:type The collection of bags used as containers.\n              NOTE that a Bag is classified as a SmallObject,meaning that it can\n              usually be picked up with one hand by the typical user.\n            NOTE that unlike SUMO this type is not restricted to fabric i.e. woven materials,\n             as plastic bags are also Bags.
