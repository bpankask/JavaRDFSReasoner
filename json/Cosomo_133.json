Ground glass made of pellets, even if of the of the proper\n        grain size, would not be natural and would not be included in this type.\n        \n        Cyc: An instances of #$TangibleStuffStateType, and a\n            specialization of #$Soil-Generic.  Each instance of\n            #$SandMob is a portion of loose granular material that\n            results from the disintegration of rocks, consisting of\n            particles smaller than gravel but
