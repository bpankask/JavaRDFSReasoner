Thus Gold is an OWL-class.  But objects composed of\n        a particular substances are instances of a separate hierarchy of PhysicalObject.\n        This differs from Cyc usage.  These substances in COSMO are related to PhysicalObjects composed of\n        each substance subtype of this class by the relation: hasComponentSubstance,\n        and subrelations.\n        \n        COSMO note: this method of representing substances present problems with a triple-based\n          logical language such as OWL.  Relations that might ordinarily refer to instances of\n          some type may need to refer to **subtypes** of a substance.  This may be and is  accomplished by\n          representing subtypes of SubstanceType, but for generality that would require a specific \n          subtype of SubstanceType for each substance.  In an FOL system, one can have relations that \n          clearly refer to subtypes e.g. producesaSubtype of [some substance], but since COSMO\n          will eventually be converted to FOL, that gereal method is not implemented in the OWL version.\n    \n        Although subtypes of PhysicalSubstance are classes, these classes do not usually\n          have any instances, since relations on substances refer to the classes of \n          substance instance of SubstanceType, the subtypes of PhysicalSubstance.\n          However,it is possible to  visualize a meaning and potential use for instances of PhysicalSubstancees.\n          Those instances would conceptually be a ***density of a physical substance***\n          such as 1.0 grams of water per milliliter or a ***fractional component of a physical substance***.\n          See TenKaratGold as an example of how the gold component is represented as\n          an instance of  FractionalComponentSubstance\n          \n          .  Density  this representaton  is not a  QuantitativeAttributeValue,\n          such as OneGramPerMilliliter, since that type of attribute value\n          does not include the substance name.  An example of an instance of a PhysicalSubstance\n          specifically, WaterWaterAtOneGramPerMilliliter is included as an illustration.\n          NOTE in this example that it is not necessary to specify the Substancename within the \n          element, because the instance of substance is already specified as an instance of the\n          specific PhysicalSubstance Water, and only its density need be added.  To be complete, the \n          temperature and pressure should be specified, but that will be for a version later than this rev1115.\n          \n          One can visualize such an instance as having units of PhysicalSubstance*Mass/Volume.\n          These instances could also be conceptualized as the derivative of a PhysicalObject with\n          respect to volume at some point within the PhysicalObject - and that would be the \n          substance at that point.  But such esoteric conceptualizations should not be\n          needed for effective use.\n\n     NOTE that a substance at some particular concentration can also be a subtype of that\n       substance.  To express that an object contains a particular concentration of\n       a substance, one can create a subclass of that substance having the \n       appropriate concentration attribute, and relate the object to that\n       concentration of substance by the relation hasConstituentSubstance.\n  \n    \n     Each PhysicalSubstance is an abstraction representing the properties\n     of aggregates composed of multiple small objects of a common type;\n     the notion of a PhysicalSubstance includes any of the common substances we encounter\n     every  day: water, air, sugar, salt, coffee ground or as a drink, beer, meat, steel,\n     plastic, etc.,  as well as less common substances such as ion plasma and groups \n     of elementary particles.  Every PhysicalSubstance has some basic unit which is the \n     object which is the unit object of that Substance, related to the Substance by\n     hasUnitObject relation.  For chemical elements  the unit object is an atom; for chemical compounds,\n     the molecule; for sand, one grain of sand, etc.   For PhysicalSubstances that are composed of \n     mixtures e.g. concrete, the formal notion of a grain is used, the grain being the\n     size of the smallest object composed of a substance, that can be subdivided so\n     that the pieces are still objects composed of the same substance.   The grain shold be ;arge\n     enough to exhibit the protoypical properties of that substance density, color, composition.\n     The grain will in general be at least eight times the size of the unit allowing division\n     in any of three planes , but for mixtures the unit may be difficult to identify,\n     and the grain will be the only\n     object identifed as characterizing the PhysicalSubstance.  For mixtures,\n     the size of the grain will depend on the sizes and proportions of the constituent objects.\n     Thus in concrete, the grain will have to be at least several times as large as the largest\n     pebble of gravel used in the mixture.  Some quantity of a PhysicalSubstance will \n     comprise a HomogeneousObject; in Cyc substances are represented as objects,\n     comparable in meaning to HomogeneousObject in COSMO.\n     \n     The commonly understood properties of substances such as water are characteristic \n     only of aggregates of the basic units atoms, molecules, grains.  To approximate the\n     commonly measured properties boiling point, melting point, density, etc. the \n     number of basic units may need to be fairly large; this will also vary with the \n     substance.  As of v0.80 this issue is not fully addressed.\n     \n    This concept must not be construed as a physical object made of some substance \n    which is the way substances are represented in Cyc - see CycNote below..  \n    PhysicalObjects which are relatively homogeneous the atmosphere, the ocean can be\n    construed as consisting of one or more PhysicalSubstances, but they are not\n    substances per se, but specific quantities of a substance, which is one\n    way to view a PhysicalObject.  For generality in COSMO, a PhysicalSubstance is the \n    material of which anything with mass is composed, including quantities of subatomic particles \n    that are contained in a certain region of space such as a plasma in a Tokomak,\n    or a group of electrons in a particle accelerator.  However, the term is usually applied\n    only to ordinary matter solid, liquid, gas; in those cases\n    the unit is an atom or molecule, and the grain size of any \n    PhysicalSubstance that is ordinary matter must contain at least 8 atoms or 8 molecules\n    so that it can be divided in two in any axis and still have multiple units \n    in the resulting parts.\n\n   NOTE: Energy is also an instance of SubstanceType actually, of\n   the subtype EnergyType , but is **not** classified\n     as a PhysicalSubstance.  Thus although each quantity of energy will have\n     some equivalent mass, that mass need not be specified.  The distinction between\n     Energy and other things that serve as PhysicalSubstances may be useful\n\n  IMPORTANT NOTE: PhysicalSubstances are categorized by the main consitutent. \n   Therefore SeaWater is considered as a subtype of Water.  The pure chemical substances\n   can be represented when desirable by creating a Pure category under the general heading\n   or, if functions are used, by using a Pure X function.\n   Thus we have a Type called PureWater.  Steel with iron as the majority \n   constituent might be considered as a subtype of Iron.\n  \n  COSMO note:  Because substances are represented in COSMO as Types classes rather than\n  instances, the specification of properties of substances gets involved,\n  and the intended meanings cannot be specified fully without the use of FOL.\n  As placeholders, some relations between substances are specified, and in OWL these\n  will be interprted as applying only to those specific Substances Type that are\n  instances of SubstanceType, while the intended meaning is that the relation\n  applies not only to the particular Type but to all subtypes as well.\n  The translation of the OWL ontology to FOL should carefully handle these \n  placeholder relations to be sure they are translated properly.\n  .\n  The restriction on hasGrainDiameter for SubstanceTypes which see should require \n  subclasses rather than instances of LengthMeasure - instances may have to be created\n  as a workaround. still not decided, v0.43.\n  \n  This representation solves some logical problems, but creates implementation\n  problems in restricted logics such as OWL.\n  COSMO uses relations such as hasComponentSubstance, which takes PhysicalSubstance\n  types instances of the metatype SubtanceType as the range restriction.\n  There are also relations which have subtypes of PhysicalSubstance instances\n  of SubstanceType as the domain restriction.  This can be accommodated in OWL.\n  However, in order to have restrictions apply to subtypes of types, the OWL restriction\n  mechanism interprets the restriction as applying to instances of the type OWL class.\n  There are no instances of PhysicalSubstance types in COSMO, and the restriction is\n  intended to apply to the subtypes, not to instances. Such restrictions on PhysicalSubstances\n  will have to be interpreted by applications as meaning that the substance represented by the\n  class has those properties.  One way to solve the problem might be to create \n  a metatype for each substance Type i.e. for each of millions of substances,\n  and have the restriction apply to the metatype - but this duplicates Types\n  as metatypes, and is unworkable.  COSMO leaves the proper implementation to the application,\n  at least until it is converted in to an FOL version, where the proper interpretations\n  can be specified by rules.\n  \n  \n  CycNote: In Cyc, PhysicalSubstances are not represented by a tree in the hierarchy, but\n     are represented by types that are physical objects Partiallytangible\n     and also instances of ExistingStufType.  In effect, Cyc considers a substance\n     as the type consisting of all PhysicalObjects that are homogeneous down\n     to a certain granularity and having a certain composition.  This can\n     be translated into the COSMO representation at the type and instance \n     level, but the Cyc metatypes are not represented in COSMO.  See\n     HomogeneousObject\n    \n    Cyc: ExistingStuffType\n        A collection of collections, and a specialization\n            of #$TemporalStuffType.  Each instance of\n            #$ExistingStuffType is a collection of things including\n            portions of things which are both temporally and spatially\n            stufflike.  Division in time or space does not destroy the\n            stufflike quality of the object down to a certain\n            granularity.    #$isa STUFFTYPE #$ExistingStuffType\n            implies both i for most instances STUFF of STUFFTYPE, for\n            any proper physical part see #$physicalParts PART of\n            STUFF, PART is also an instance of STUFFTYPE and ii for\n            all instances STUFF of STUFFTYPE, for most proper physical\n            parts PART of STUFF, PART is also an instance of STUFFTYPE.\n            For example, every piece of wood is temporally stufflike: if\n            W-168 is a piece of wood during 1996, then its also a\n            piece of wood for the one-minute time-slice 9:05am 7/7/96.\n            Its also spatially stufflike: if we take that piece of\n            wood W-168 and cut it in half, we have two things which are\n            both pieces of wood.  Since every piece of wood is both\n            temporally and spatially stufflike, #$Wood is an instance of\n            #$ExistingStuffType.  Other instances of #$ExistingStuffType\n            include the collections #$AppleJuice, #$IceCream, #$Diamond,\n            #$WaxedPaper, and #$StriatedMuscle. See the comment for\n            #$StuffType to learn more about the distinctions between,\n            and the need for, these four collections: #$StuffType,\n            #$ObjectType, #$ExistingStuffType, and #$ExistingObjectType.    \n    \n    \n  The senses 1 and 2 of matter in Random House Webster are conceptually\n  the same as this type, where COSMO interprets sense 2 is the most generic matter of which\n  the instances of sense 1 are subtypes:\n   1. \tthe substance or substances of which any physical object consists or is composed:\n        the matter of which the earth is made.\n   2. \tphysical or corporeal substance in general, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous,\n          esp. as distinguished from incorporeal substance, as spirit or mind, \n          or from qualities, actions, and the like.\n  \n    Corresponds to noun senses 1 and 2 of substance and sense 1 of stuff and\n       sense 1 of matter and sense 1 of material in WordNet;\n       \n       NOTE WN substance sense 2 has no subtypes and is probably just improperly split from\n         sense 1, which is indistinguishable, in that the subtypes of sense 1 are \n         recognizable as stuff-like substances.  This may be due to the lack of clear distinction in WN\n         between object e.g. atom and substances.\n       \n       NOTE however, substance is not directly related to stuff and stuff is not\n       related to matter in WordNet, and matter is not used typically\n       as a synonym of substance in ordinary speech.\n       This difference in usage reflects a difference in the way substances are\n       conceived - as either some abstract stuff of which objects consist, or\n       of the collections of all objects of that composition, as in Cyc.

A PersitentState can be represented\n     even though some attributes of a system may be changing, if the knowledge enterer\n     chooses to focus only on those attributes that are not changing, and does\n     not represent the attributes that are changing.  The salkient thing that is not changing \n     is pointed to by the relation hasSubjectOfState.\n     \n        For example, a person can  be represented as being in a sitting state even though \n     s/he may be doing many things in that interval of time.  An agent can be doing things during\n     a PersistentState, as long as the relevant attribute that characterizes the\n     state remains during all parts of the state, within some level of granularity.\n     \n     NOTE that the restriction requires that for any instance of such a PersistentState,\n        the entity that is in that state be specified.\n    \n    NOTE That if an Object is specified as having some Attribute during \n    some interval of time, that is equivalent to specifying the existence of a\n    PersistentState for that Object during that interval.\n    NOTE also that representing a PersistentState in which some attributes\n    remain constant over some interval of time does *not* imply that there\n    are no attributes that change.  A person sitting in a chair can be \n    represented as a persistent state of sitting, while at the same time many\n    internal biological proceses may be going on.  The meaning a a PersistentState,\n    as well as for Events generally, only extends to those attributes or fluents\n    that are explicitly represented in or logically inferred from the \n    represented description of the Event/PersistentState.\n    \n    \n    COSMO note: linguistically, the existence of a PersistentState may be expressed by\n     asserting a state, condition or situation, or by\n     using a verb or an adjective.  One can say the airplane was\n     flying for three hours; the balloon stayed in the air several days; Tom remained sitting\n     during the party; his face was red for five minutes; He was angry for a week; \n     the motor ran continuously for a week.\n    \n     COSMO note:  DOLCE has a convoluted description of\n     what a State is.  For COSMO, a PersistentState what appears to be\n     a State in DOLCE it is very simply an Event\n     in which none of the represented attributes change over some interval of time\n     - - i.e. nothing changes that the knowledge \n     enterer considers significant for her/his purposes.  This can be \n     viewed as the limiting case of an Event, in which so little \n     of significance happens that it is not worth mentioning. Or, it can\n     be simply the representation of certain attributes of a system that are\n     not changing, while ignoring other attributes that may be changing.\n\n     DOLCE: Within stative occurrences, we distinguish between \n     states and processes according to homeomericity: sitting is \n     classified as a state  but running is classified as a process,\n     since there are very short temporal parts  of a running that \n     are not themselves runnings.In general, states differ from situations \n     because they are not assumed to have a description from which they depend. \n     They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not require a \n     description as a unifying criterion.On the other hand, at any time,\n     one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which \n     a state of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes\n     a situation.Since the decision of designing an explicit description \n     that unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, \n     application, etc., when aligning an ontology to DLP, there can be \n     indecision on where to align a state-oriented class. \n     For example, in the WordNet alignment, we have decided to put only \n     some physical states under state, e.g. turgor, in order to \n     stress the social orientedness of DLP. But whereas we need \n     to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive turgor states,\n     these will be put under situation.Similar considerations are made for \n     the other types of perdurants in DOLCE.

A PersitentState can be represented\n     even though some attributes of a system may be changing, if the knowledge enterer\n     chooses to focus only on those attributes that are not changing, and does\n     not represent the attributes that are changing.  The salkient thing that is not changing \n     is pointed to by the relation hasSubjectOfState.\n     \n        For example, a person can  be represented as being in a sitting state even though \n     s/he may be doing many things in that interval of time.  An agent can be doing things during\n     a PersistentState, as long as the relevant attribute that characterizes the\n     state remains during all parts of the state, within some level of granularity.\n     \n     NOTE that the restriction requires that for any instance of such a PersistentState,\n        the entity that is in that state be specified.\n    \n    NOTE That if an Object is specified as having some Attribute during \n    some interval of time, that is equivalent to specifying the existence of a\n    PersistentState for that Object during that interval.\n    NOTE also that representing a PersistentState in which some attributes\n    remain constant over some interval of time does *not* imply that there\n    are no attributes that change.  A person sitting in a chair can be \n    represented as a persistent state of sitting, while at the same time many\n    internal biological proceses may be going on.  The meaning a a PersistentState,\n    as well as for Events generally, only extends to those attributes or fluents\n    that are explicitly represented in or logically inferred from the \n    represented description of the Event/PersistentState.\n    \n    \n    COSMO note: linguistically, the existence of a PersistentState may be expressed by\n     asserting a state, condition or situation, or by\n     using a verb or an adjective.  One can say the airplane was\n     flying for three hours; the balloon stayed in the air several days; Tom remained sitting\n     during the party; his face was red for five minutes; He was angry for a week; \n     the motor ran continuously for a week.\n    \n     COSMO note:  DOLCE has a convoluted description of\n     what a State is.  For COSMO, a PersistentState what appears to be\n     a State in DOLCE it is very simply an Event\n     in which none of the represented attributes change over some interval of time\n     - - i.e. nothing changes that the knowledge \n     enterer considers significant for her/his purposes.  This can be \n     viewed as the limiting case of an Event, in which so little \n     of significance happens that it is not worth mentioning. Or, it can\n     be simply the representation of certain attributes of a system that are\n     not changing, while ignoring other attributes that may be changing.\n\n     DOLCE: Within stative occurrences, we distinguish between \n     states and processes according to homeomericity: sitting is \n     classified as a state  but running is classified as a process,\n     since there are very short temporal parts  of a running that \n     are not themselves runnings.In general, states differ from situations \n     because they are not assumed to have a description from which they depend. \n     They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not require a \n     description as a unifying criterion.On the other hand, at any time,\n     one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which \n     a state of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes\n     a situation.Since the decision of designing an explicit description \n     that unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, \n     application, etc., when aligning an ontology to DLP, there can be \n     indecision on where to align a state-oriented class. \n     For example, in the WordNet alignment, we have decided to put only \n     some physical states under state, e.g. turgor, in order to \n     stress the social orientedness of DLP. But whereas we need \n     to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive turgor states,\n     these will be put under situation.Similar considerations are made for \n     the other types of perdurants in DOLCE.   A different notion of event\n     dealing with change is currently investigated for further developments:\n     being achievement, accomplishment, state, event, etc. can \n     be also considered aspects of processes or of parts of them.\n     For example, the same process rock erosion in the Sinni valley\n     can be conceptualized as an accomplishment what has brought the current\n     state that e.g. we are trying to explain, as an achievement the erosion process \n     as the result of a previous accomplishment, as a state if we collapse \n     the time interval of the erosion into a time point, or as an event\n     what has changed our focus from a state to another.In the erosion case, \n     we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a \n     causation focus, b effectual focus, c condensation d transition causality.\n     If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together, we need \n     to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria i.e. a description,\n     according to which that process is circumstantiated in a situation.\n     The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation.\n     \n     Includes noun senses 4 of state, senses 1, 2, and 3 of situation sense 1 of thing \n        and part of verb sense 1 of stay and  senses 1 and 2 of remain, in WordNet\n        and includes verb sense 2 of stay \n         which is more specifically represented by the COSMO subtype RemainingInaLocation:\n         4. 142 state - the way something is with respect to its main attributes;\n         the current state of knowledge;
