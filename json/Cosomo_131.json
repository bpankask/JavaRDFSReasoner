This is very broad, and can be used to express notions \n        such as x is within ten miles of y or x is within an hour of reaching y or \n        the explosions were less than five minutes apart or Jacks IQ is within five points of Jills\n        or the DOW is within five points of its all-time high;\n        the kinds of things related are limited only by how one might relate things in \n        a quantitative fashion. This expresses the generic notion of distance, whether abstract or\n        physical.  This type requires two specific relations to create an instance: \n           1 hasMaximumDistance points to some QuantitativeAttributeValue Quantifier and UnitOfMeasure \n             that describes the  maximum distance in any units, not just spatial; and \n           2 hasProximateEntity points to an entity of any type that the subject of the relation\n               is distant from, in any quantitative attribute, at a maximum value specified by the\n               hasMaximumDistance relation.\n               \n         NOTE that the relation isNearTo can be used to express vague terms of physical nearness,\n           but this type and its associated relations are required to express not just nearness,\n           and not just physical proximity,but distance in any measurable dimension.\n           \n          This type is structured as a Group, and the intention is that the First element is\n            that pointed to by the hasMaximumDistance relation,\n            and the second element is pointed to by the hasProximateEntity relation.\n            \n          Linguistically, a ternary relation equivalent would be structured as using ESKIF notation\n            {?X isWthin ?D of ?Y} \n            to mean that ?X is within ?D measure in some units of ?Y by some quantitative mesaure.\n           \n           IN WordNet the word proximity is used only to express spatial nearness, and this more\n             general notion is not close enough for mapping; the nearest English term is\n             within as used in ?X is within ?Y of ?Z  where ?Y is a quantitative measure.\n           \n           Although this concept does not require that the entities related are near in any\n             formal sense - the quantitative distance is not restricted - the relaton will\n             tpyicall be used, as is the expression within ?Measure of ?Entity when the\n             entities being related are in some sense near on that measure dimension.\n             \n             \n            Includes noun senses 1 and 2 of proximity in Wordnet:\n                1. 1 proximity, propinquity - the property of being close together\n                2. proximity - the region close around a person or thing\n       .",":Punishing rdfs:subClassOf 088c7904-3297-49e5-b29b-0217fbe9d718",":PollenGrain rdfs:subClassOf :ExternalAnatomicalPart",":HistoricalNarrative :wnsense history3n",":Mass rdfs:subClassOf :PhysicalAttribute",":TopSurface rdf:type :PhysicalObjectType",":Heavy rdfs:subClassOf :QualitativeAttributeValue",":DiningRoom :guid bd58c88e-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270",":Jumping rdfs:comment NOTE that this includes a single jump or leap, and also\n           multiple jumps.  @ToDo: Perhaps distinguish??\n           Any kind of body movement that involves both feet off the ground at\n            one time other than running forward.
