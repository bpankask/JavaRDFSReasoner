No value can change within a State.\n           NOTE that one can represent the state of an individual relation\n           or attribute for some Object, without specifying how other\n           attributes may or may not change.  Therfore one can, for example,\n           represent a Feeling as a PersistentState that continues without\n           change in value over some interval of time, while other\n           attributes or relations on the same Person change dramatically.\n           Each attribute of each Object represented in a State can be\n           represented as a State separately from the states of other\n           Objects.\n        FunctionalProcess: The full set of LinguisticAssertions specifying the values of\n           fluents at each time point or smaller TimeInterval\n           within a TimeInterval in which the Process is defined.  The set of\n           LinguisticAssertions relate times to values,and in that respect is\n           analogous to a mathematical function.  In analogy to a mathematical\n           function, one can derive a rate for a Process in cases where\n           the values are quantified by taking the ratio of difference in\n           value to difference in time for any TimeInterval in which a change\n           of value is specified.  This rate may change from time to time\n           during a FunctionalProcess.\n           \n           **NOTE**  A FunctionalProcess may also be defined, not by specifying\n           the individual values of the fluents at points in time, but by\n           specifying the manner in which a fluent can change over time.\n           One specific example of this is a **differential equation** which\n           can be used to take the value of a fluent at some starting point in\n           time, and calculate the values at subsequent points in time.\n           Thus a FunctionalProcess can have, as its TimeIndexedAssertion,\n           a differential equation.\n           @ToDo: the specifics of how a differential equation are to be represented\n           have not been elaborated as of rev837.\n        \n        **Linguistically** an Event may be labeled by a verb or a noun.  The arguments\n          to an event e.g. the participants may be implied by use of some linguistic \n          terms e.g. skating implies the use of skates as a tool.  Any given event type\n          may subsume many subtypes, each being an Event with some different type of \n          participant.  Whether or not to represent such subtypes explicitly will\n          depend in part on whether the participants are mentioned explicitly in \n          a linguistic text, or whether there are linguistic terms that implicitly \n          assume a certain type of participant.  As of rev835, there is no\n          systematic criterion for deciding whether to explicitly represent events\n          with a certain type of participant as subtypes of the more general type,\n          other than whether there are English words that imply a certain type of\n          participant without that participant being mentioned explicitly in text \n          e.g. Baking is a subtype of HeatingProcess, using an Oven as an instrument.\n        \n        Event: focuses on the values of the fluents at the beginning and ending of some\n          TimeInterval, but also includes the FunctionalProcess that specifies\n          the fluent values at times between the beginning and ending.  Since the\n          focus of an Event is on the change from one time point to the next, \n          one cannot specify a rate in the same sense as for a FunctionalProcess,\n          where the rate may change many times during the FunctionalProcess.\n          For an Event, one can derive a single rate value that specifies the overall\n          ratio of change of fluent value to time, between the beginning\n          and ending points, and for any instance of Event, only one such rate can be\n          defined.\n           \n                \n      Although logically included in each Event are the starting and ending times,\n       see relations hasStartingTimePoint and hasEndingTimePoint, these may not be\n       known, and creating an instance of Event does not require specifying those\n       times if not known.\n      \n       NOTE that the FunctionalProcess which is a component of the Event *contains*\n         all of the elements contained in the Event, in that it contains itself,\n         and also contains the states at the beginning and end.  While *containing* all of\n         those elements, however, it is nevertheless a distinctly different concept,\n         since the Event specifically selects out of the FunctionalProcess the \n         beginning and ending states as characteristic of the Event.  The Event\n         is not a FunctionalProcess, but *contains* a FunctionalProcess as a\n         component element.  A FunctionalProcess can be derived from an Event, and\n         an Event can be derived from a FunctionalProcess that is defined over\n         some interval of time.  A FunctionalProcess that has only one time point\n         in it also represents a special kind of Event, the limiting case\n         of an InstantaneousState.  NOTE also that an instance of FunctionalProcess\n         that is defined by a mathematical function relating properties to time\n         must have associated with it some time interval during which it is asserted to\n         be valid, in order to be an instance.\n         \n       NOTE also that this representation of Event does not resemble a\n       perdurantist history which focuses on some region of space-time.\n       Regions of space-time are represented as SpatiotemporalRegion in\n       COSMO, but the only spatial regions of relevance to an Event are those\n       that can be derived from the locations of the Objects that participate\n       in an Event.  The significant conceptual components of an Event are the\n       properties fluents of the Objects that participate in the Event,\n       and insofar as the locations of the Objects may be, but are not necessarily,\n       represented in the Event, those locations may be significant, but except in\n       Events solely depicting motion, the locations are incidental rather than central\n       to the changes represented by the Event.\n\n      \n      Each Event represents one or more changes that occur to\n    the attributes  or relations fluents of one or more objects during \n    some defined interval of time or for abstract Events, within some\n    interval on the dimension of causality; the net changes are\n    represented by the state at the beginning of the event and the state at the\n    end of the Event.  In the physical world, real Events typically\n    have multiple intermediate stages, and nothing occurs instantaneously,\n    but some non-physical Events such as a change of title for a Person may\n    occur at a precise moment by prior arrangement.\n       The representation of intermediate stages of an Event can be explicit, with the\n    included events related to the whole event by the hasSubEvent relation or\n    hasTemporalPart relation.  The first can be more specific about one\n    of serveral fluents that vary during an event. The temporal part relation\n    between Events must relate a subevent that includes alll of the fluents \n    represented in the whole Event.\n    \n    Each Event includes implicitly a Process that specifies the course of each\n    fluent between the start and end times.  At this point v0.39 there is\n    no explicit representation of the included Process, but each FunctionalProcess\n    will, if represented explicitly, have an associate time granularity indicating\n    the minimal intervals over which the change in the fluents are represented.\n    The size of the granularity intervals during which FunctionalProcess states\n    are represented will depends on the discretion of the ontologist for the\n    purposes of the representation.\n    \n    COSMO note: note that in some ontologies and situation logics , Event\n    is used to refer to a change in state that is considered instantaneous.\n    In COSMO, such an Event is a subtype of the more general event, which is a \n    change in state that occurs over some interval of time which,\n    for instantaneous changes would be a zero-length time interval. \n    \n    NOTE also that for some Events, such as cyclic Events, merely representing\n    the starting and ending states - which may be identical - loses the\n    whole meaning of the Event; so intermediate states must also be\n    represented in some manner to provide meaning to the Event.\n\n    Called: EventCyc; ProcessSUMO; eventDOLCE; ProcessualSPAN-BFO\n\n    ************  NOTE on BFO Process  ******************************\n    COSMO: BFO the Type most closely representing COSMO Event\n     is Process, so that BFO type is made synonymous with\n     Event.
